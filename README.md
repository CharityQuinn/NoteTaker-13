# NoteTaker-13


This project allows a user to create a list of Notes.  I had hoped to put in some trash cans or checkmarks to show that some note was taken care of and needs to be closed. I have added code to delete but ran out of time to add the "button" to start the process.  I have enjoyed working on this and have better implimentation ideas for it but those will have to be added later. I have loaded this on to Heroku but am still working out some kinks.

This project will be useful if you are forgetting to do things and would like to have them listed for you in an easy to see/store/change them.  

If you have any questions, please **Slack** me a message.
I will maintain this project but it is only here with the *tremendous help from my TAs and tutor.
